# First goal is to just extract text from the log file and print out log lines
# Worry about making it more complex afterwards
# I think I will need to use regular expressions to extract the fields from the log lines.
# I will also need to take arguments into the script call that point to the file
# Later on I can deal with ingesting the logs into a database.
